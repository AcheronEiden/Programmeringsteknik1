# Programmeringsteknik 1 (Python)
This is for saving my assignments & created files for the course Programmeringsteknik 1 1TD433 - Uppsala Universitet
This is a course given for python beginners. The course is given in swedish so all comments etc are in swedish.

* The first assignment "Obligatorisk Uppgift 1" has three subproblems named "deluppgift 1-3"
* The second assignment "Obligatorisk Uppgift 2" has two subproblems named "deluppgift 1-2"
* The third assignment "Obligatorisk Uppgift 3" has three subproblems named "deluppgift 1-2"
* The fourth assignment "Obligatorisk Uppgift 4" has three subproblems named "Obliagatorisk uppgift A-C"
* The fifth assignment "Obligatorisk Uppgift 5" has two subproblems named "deluppgift 1-2"

I did the course in 2020 but this github in 2022 so the structure of the assignments aint easy to read cuz I took all the codes and put them in the same script (for every assignment respectively). Dont really have the time to restructure the scripts for easier navigation XD
